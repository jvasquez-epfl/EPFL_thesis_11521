# EPFL_thesis_11521
Stop-and-go microfluidic QPI system for single-cell phenotyping of refractive organelles and cellular components
List of code:
1. complex_field_holo_extract.ipynb --> code to process the holograms, do Fourier filtering, bacnkground substraction, unwrapping, and cell detection and cropping
2. segmentation_rembg.ipynb --> code to segment the cell images
3. model_classification_senes.ipynb --> code with the phenotypic feature extraction and the logistic regression, XGB, and ResNet18 models
